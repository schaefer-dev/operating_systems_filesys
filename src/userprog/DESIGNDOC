struct lock lock_filesystem;
global lock defined in syscall.h which is used in load to protect against
data races during the exectution of load()

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

The first important step regarding Argument Passing is the execution
of process_execute. In this function we make sure to copy the passed
file_name into a new page. (which is important to avoid races between
the caller and the load process of the newly started process. In this new
page we use strtok_r to extract the first "word" contained in the passed
string. This first word is the command_name (name of executable) which
is being passed to thread_create together with the page of the entire
string. It is obviously very important to free the newly allocated page
after thread_create is finished.

When start_process is being called later on, we tokenize the arguments
contained in the page we passed over to thread_create again by using
strtok_r. During the tokenizing Process we use strlpy with size tokensize+1
because we have to guarantee the terminating \0 character after each argument
token.

These arguments are pushed (in reverse order) to a argument_page
which we allocate to store the arguments of this process which will later
be put on the stack according to C 80x86 Calling Convention. We push them
in reverse order, to make the process of building the stack in stack_setup
easier.

start_process eventually calls load and passes the filename and the page
which contains the tokenized arguments in reverse order. Again it is important
to free the allocated pages after load() has returned.

setup_stack is being called during the load execution and takes care
of building the stack according to C 80x86 Calling Convention. It takes
the arguments contained in the argument page one by one and decrements the
esp (starting at PHYS_BASE) according to the size of this token and verifies
if the esp is still valid in the current context (not outside page etc. to
avoid overflowing the stack).
The stack is built exactly as explained in Section 3.5.1 Program Startup
Details (again - everything one by one with verification of esp before any
data is being written!) You have to be very careful while decrementing the
ESP, because some values are characters (1byte) some are pointers (4byte)
and others are int (4bytes).


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r() can be called in multiple threads simultaneously or in nested
loops because every execution of strtok_r has its own pointer which tracks
the context of this strtok_r execution which is proided by the caller.
Strtok does not allow the caller to pass this pointer and just has this
context internally for the next execution (which could be somewhere else
-> data races) Pintos uses strtok_r because the kernel needs to be reentrant.


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

A big advantage of this is very obvious: We would spend less time in the
Kernel which is advantagous for the overall system performance. 

Additionally this check would enable us to verify the existance of the
executable and checking the arguments before they are being passed (e.g.
max size). It would also be possible to apply certain preprocessing
in general to these arguments, which might e.g. save instructions by
optimizing something like "cd; cd home; cd test;" to "cd ~/home/test".
While all this might be possible in the Kernel, it would add a lot of
complexity and potential issues to it, which is a bad idea (keyword:
Abstraction)

			     SYSTEM CALLS
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

Additions to struct thread:
    /* List of all open files of this thread. */
    struct list file_list;
    this list contains values of type: struct file_entry which correspond
    to this thread. (explanation of file_entry below)

    /* List of all child processes of this thread */
    struct list child_list;
    this List contains all children of this process of type:
    struct child_process which correspond to this thread (which acts as parent)

    /* the executable of this thread */
    struct file *executable;
    the open file which is being executed in this thread (important to close
    it after thread exits)

    /* lock to protect operations in child_list */
    struct lock child_list_lock;
    this lock guarantees that at most one thread can work on the child_list
    (explained above) at the same time to avoid data races

    /* save the reference of its own child_process struct to
      change the load status after load is done */
    struct child_process *child_process;
    The struct child_process contains values like exit_value, etc. for
    this thread which can be accessed by this threads parent.

    /* Counter to give every file in file list a unique fd */
    int current_fd;
    Counter for file_descriptor, which guarantees that every file descriptor
    in this thread has a unique int.


New Struct file_entry:
    /* Struct to save open files of a thread in a linked list */
    struct file_entry
      {
        struct file *file;
        int fd;
        struct list_elem elem; 
      };
    this struct contains the reference to the open file and the unique
    file descriptor int corresponding to it.


New Struct child_process:
    /*  every process which is created by a parent process is considered a
        child process and contains a struct child_process which stores all
        important values for child processes */
    struct child_process
      {
        int exit_status;
        pid_t pid;
        pid_t parent;
        bool terminated;
        bool waited_for;
        int successfully_loaded;
        struct lock child_process_lock;
        struct condition loaded;
        struct condition terminated_cond;
        struct list_elem elem;
      };

      - exit_status saves the status with which this thread (every child_process
      belongs to exactly 1 thread) exited.
      - pid saves the process id of this particular thread/child
      - parent saves the process id of the parent of this particular
      thread/child
      - terminated contains whether the process/child has already
      exited.
      - waited_for tracks if the parent of this child is waiting for
      this child to terminate.
      - successfully_loaded contains the returnvalue of load, which has
      to be accessible to the parent.
      - child_process_lock is important to guarantee that at most one
      thread is reading/writing information inside this struct (because
      parent and child access this struct)
      - loaded is being signaled after laod is finished, so that parent
      gets notified as soon as load finished successfully or not.
      - terminated_cond is being signaled after the child has exited,
      because parent might be waiting for this child.

typedef int pid_t;
      pid_t is an int and equivalent to tid_t (1:1 mapping)

  /* NOT_LOADED value for processes which are still in 
    the process of loading */
  #define NOT_LOADED 0
  #define LOAD_SUCCESS 1
  #define LOAD_FAILURE 2
  These values are being used to save valus into the loaded field of struct
  child_process.


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

File descriptors are being created in the syscall_open and are unique only
withing a single process. This is sufficient (and better) because
file descriptors can only be used inside the process in which they are being
created because every thread can only access its own file descriptors.
Closing a file will result in the removal of the file_entry structure belonging
to this file and additionally remove this entry in the file_list list
belonging to the running process.
